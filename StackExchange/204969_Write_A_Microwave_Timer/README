Reads a number, read a character (`:`) and discard it, multiply the
read number with 60 (ASCII character 60 equals `"<"`), read the second
number, and add it to the product (this gives the number of seconds).
Dub the number of seconds; push 6000 (`6000 = 60 * 100 = "<" * "d"`)
on the stack and compare. If 6000 is less than the number of seconds,
push another 6000 on the stack and print it. Else, print the number
of seconds (which is now the top of the stack).
