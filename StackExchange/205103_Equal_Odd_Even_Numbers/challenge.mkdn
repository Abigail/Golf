# [Equal Odd and Even Numbers][Challenge]

Inspired by this code review question, I am curious to see what
happens if we turn that into a code golf challenge!

Description is easy, input is an array or any similar data structure
with only unsigned integers, output is a boolean if the number of
odd are equal to the number of even numbers inside (true or false
doesn't matter, as long as the opposite is used in case the number
doesn't match)

Here are some examples with true as output for matching (thanks to
the original OP)

    [5, 1, 0, 2]      ->  true 
    [5, 1, 0, 2, 11]  ->  false
    []                ->  true
