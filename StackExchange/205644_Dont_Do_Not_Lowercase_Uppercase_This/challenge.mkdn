[DON'Tâ€¦ do NOT lowercase UPPERCASE this][codegolf]

Write a program that outputs its input unchanged. However:

    * If all uppercase characters are removed from the program,
      it lowercases all uppercase letters.
    * If all lowercase characters are removed from the program,
      it uppercases all lowercase letters.

Transforming characters beyond the basic Latin [A-Za-z] range is
optional, but any character with both uppercase and lowercase
counterparts within Unicode qualifies for "removal" from your program.
