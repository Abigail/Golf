# [Generate a valid Windows 95 OEM Key][codegolf]

## Introduction

Windows 95 used a very simple algorithm for verifying license keys.
The scheme of an OEM license key always looked like this:

    xxxyy-OEM-NNNNNNN-zzzzz

The day can be anything within 001-366, and the year cannot be lower
than 95 or above 03.

`xxx` represents the day of the year the key was printed on (for
example 192 = 10th of July) and is a number between 001-366. `yy`
represents the year the key was printed on and cannot be lower than
95 or above 03.

This means for example, a key with 19296 as the first segment was
printed on 10th of July 1996.

The second segment is always OEM.

The third segment (NN..) is always starts with `00` and the sum of
the digits has to be divisible by 7

The fourth segment is irrelevant, provided the field is the appropriate
length, but has to be filled out with digits.

## Challange

Given a string, output a truthy or falsy value whether this oem key
is valid or not.

## Rules

    * You may provide a function or a program
    * This is code-golf, so the submission with the least amount of bytes wins!
